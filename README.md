# News-Based Chatbot Q&A System

This project builds a powerful news-based Q&A chatbot designed to provide users with fast, accurate responses to questions based on recent news articles. Leveraging the capabilities of large language models like GPT-3, alongside document-based question answering (QA), the chatbot allows users to interact with real-time and historical news data.

## Libraries
- HuggingFace: For working with transformer models like GPT-3.
- Newspaper and Beautiful Soup: Extracts and processes news articles from the web.
- Pandas: For reading and manipulating CSV files.
- Langchain: Manages language models and integrates them with vector-based retrieval systems.
- llama-cpp-python: Lightweight model inference using the LLaMA architecture.
- TQDM: For progress tracking in data processing tasks.
- Sentence Transformers: Embeds textual data for efficient similarity search.
- Chromadb: Stores and manages embeddings for real-time similarity search.

## Objectives
- Understand the process of building a chatbot using ChatGPT and document-based QA.
- Explore techniques like fine-tuning GPT-3, direct prompt-engineering, and integrating vector-indexing for efficient knowledge retrieval.
- Enhance client service and engagement with state-of-the-art chatbot technology.
- Learn how to handle large news datasets and efficiently store embeddings in a database for rapid querying.
